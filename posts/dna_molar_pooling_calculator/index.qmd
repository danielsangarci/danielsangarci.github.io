## The Problem: Mass ≠ Molecules

In the laboratory, we are often taught to quantify DNA in nanograms (ng). However, for biological reactions like **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)**, **Gibson Assembly**, or **PCR pooling**, the weight of the DNA matters much less than the **number of molecules**.

If you mix a 500bp amplicon and a 2000bp amplicon at the same mass (e.g., 50ng each), you actually have **4 times more molecules** of the small fragment. This imbalance can ruin sequencing libraries or lower cloning efficiency.

## The Solution

I developed the **DNA Molar Pooling Calculator** to solve this. It is an R Shiny application that automates the physics of DNA normalization. By calculating based on **molarity (fmol)** rather than mass, it ensures perfectly balanced pools regardless of fragment size.

### Key Features

-   **Universal:** Works for Nanopore, Illumina, PacBio, or standard cloning vectors.
-   **Batch Mode:** You can paste data directly from Excel (Sample Name, Conc1, Conc2...) to process entire plates at once.
-   **Safety Checks:** The app automatically flags samples (in red) that are too dilute to meet your target concentration.
