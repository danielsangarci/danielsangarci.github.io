Understanding the rules of coexistence requires looking across different levels of biological organization. My research focuses on the **assembly mechanisms of ant communities** and how these patterns scale up to influence their associated microbial life.

The core of my current work is the study of **complex co-occurrence networks**. I combine data from ant community composition with microbial profiling to explore how host-level interactions (like competition or thermal filtering) dictate the structure of the microbiome. By analyzing these **nested networks**, I can decipher if the microbiome assembly is a direct reflection of the host's environment or a result of complex biotic filters within the ant community.

The goal is to move beyond simple species lists and build a multi-level framework that predicts how global change—from urbanization to climate shifts—affects the stability of both macro and micro-ecological networks.
